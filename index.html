				<h2>Video Shoot</h2>
				<p>The video shoot dates will be May 18th and 19th. Right now, we are in the process of casting and pre-production planning. We will need the help of the Skinner student body for both!
				<br><br>
				We will be holding another day of casting this coming Friday, March 15th! We will be casting for the following parts:
				<br><br>
				Mike<br>
				Allie<br>
				Zack<br>
				Stanley
				<br><br>			
				Please come try out for these parts if you are even mildly interested! We are going to have a lot of fun!
				<br><br>
				We are also looking for crew members who want to help us SHOOT the video! That's right, if you don't want to be in the video, you can help us make it. Spots are limited so stay tuned for updates on signing up!					
				<br><br>
				We hope to see you be a part of this event!

				<h2>Backstory</h2>
				<p>My name is Joe Templeton and I do video production in Denver, CO. I saw CITRA perform at a concert last summer and their energy was so insane, I knew I had to shoot a video for them. Even if I had to do it for free. So, I reached out to the band to express my interest. I told them I had a concept for a video that took place in a school. They were also interested but we needed a school.<br><br>So, we reached out to several historic Denver schools, in search of a stunning location. Many schools were interested but one school in particular stood out: Skinner Middle School. It’s the perfect backdrop for our story and their Principal, Grant Varveris, was down with the project from day one. He has been extremely supportive in making this project a reality. We are planning to shoot a music video at the school, with the help of the students. We want them to be a part of our cast and crew! We also plan to monetize the project and give Skinner the proceeds. Maybe it will help them start a film/video program!</p>

				<h2>Sponsors</h2>
				<p>Since no one is getting paid to work on this video and it has no budget, we are dependent on sponsors to make this project happen! We would like to thank the following sponsors for making this project a reality:
					<br>
					<br>Auto Nation Dodge Ram Arapahoe
					<br>Hooters Colorado
					<br>Black Cabin Press
					<br>Angel Light Pyrotechnics
