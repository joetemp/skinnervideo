				<h2>CITRA</h2>
				<p>Hailing from Denver, CO... High-energy, guitar-driven grit-rock weaving its way through soulful, heartfelt melodies. Bright. Fast. Fun. Loud. CITRA.
				<br><br>
				CITRA tore into the Denver music scene in January, 2016 with their debut EP - Ocean. The EP promised a bright future for the band, released only three months after their meeting. The album rockets off with the opening track "Settle Down", and weaves it's way through an eclectic mix of melodic, at times harrowing, non-stop rock, highlighted by the band's pleadingly powerful title track, "Ocean". Armed with a care-free style the band aims to inject a bit of fun into the EDM and folk-rock dominated Denver music scene.
				<br><br>
				Following the release of their debut EP, Ocean, CITRA returned to the studio in the summer of 2016 to begin recording the follow-up single, "Air" accompanied by the B-side titled "My My Mind". Released in January of 2017, the single looked to build on the momentum the band had built over their first year together. Contrasting in style, the songs continue to illustrate that CITRA will be a hard act to paint into a stylistic corner, the two tracks representing vastly different wings of the ever-clouded indie rock genre.
