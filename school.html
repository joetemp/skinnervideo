				<h2>Skinner</h2>
				<p>From their website: 
				<br><br>
				"Built in 1921 as one of the country’s finest examples of a “Junior High” and the first in Denver, Skinner aimed to keep students in school by offering an enriched curriculum in order to meet the diverse needs of adolescents. Fast forward nearly 100 years: A visit to Skinner Middle School reveals that very school, geared to the 21st century students...
				<br><br>
				Our spotlight on the ‘whole child’ is evident as we offer not only superior Math and Literacy instruction, but enrichment courses, activities and community-building through our unique Learning Families."
				<br><br>
				That is why Skinner has chosen to partner with the prodcution team and CITRA. They think it can provide a unique learning opportunity for these kids. We agree! That's part of why we're doing this too and why we've chosen to involve the student body so heavily. These kids are awesome and we're excited to work with them!
